## 53. Maximum Subarray

---

**Medium**


Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.



Example 1:
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]  
Output: 6  
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.  


Example 2:
Input: nums = [1]  
Output: 1  

Example 3:
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]  
Output: 23

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105  
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104


Follow up: If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Solution

```
class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int maxsum = nums[0];
        int cursum = 0;
        for(int i : nums){
            if(cursum<0){
                cursum = 0;
            }
            cursum = cursum+i;
            maxsum = Math.max(maxsum,cursum);
            
        }
        return maxsum;
    }
}
