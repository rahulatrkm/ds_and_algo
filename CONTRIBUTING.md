make sure your repositories are related to this...
like if your repo is rel;ated to dsa then make sure upload your repo in dsa folder if not available then make folder by "\" symbol.
ex:-i made a hello world program in c++ language then ,
if C++ folder didnt made then i have to submit repo like this:-C/hello_World.cpp
like this....hope you will understand
