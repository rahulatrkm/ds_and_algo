Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until 
the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the easiest searching 
algorithm.

Example:
Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 110;
Output: 6
Explanation: Element x is present at index 6

Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 175;
Output: -1

Explanation: Element x is not present in arr[].

Follow the below idea to solve the problem:
Iterate from 0 to N-1 and compare the value of every index with x if they match return index

Follow the given steps to solve the problem:

1.Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
2.If x matches with an element, return the index.
3.If x doesnâ€™t match with any of the elements, return -1.
