Binary Search Algorithm: The basic steps to perform Binary Search are:

Begin with the mid element of the whole array as a search key.
If the value of the search key is equal to the item then return an index of the search key.
Or if the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.
Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
Repeatedly check from the second point until the value is found or the interval is empty.

Binary Search Algorithm can be implemented in the following two ways:
1. Iteration Method

    binarySearch(arr, x, low, high)
        repeat till low = high
               mid = (low + high)/2
                   if (x == arr[mid])
                   return mid
                   else if (x > arr[mid]) // x is on the right side
                       low = mid + 1
   
                   else                  // x is on the left side
                       high = mid - 1
                      
2.Recursive Method (The recursive method follows the divide and conquer approach)-

    binarySearch(arr, x, low, high)
           if low > high
               return False 
   
           else
               mid = (low + high) / 2 
                   if x == arr[mid]
                   return mid
       
               else if x > arr[mid]        // x is on the right side
                   return binarySearch(arr, x, mid + 1, high)
               
               else                        // x is on the left side
                   return binarySearch(arr, x, low, mid - 1)
