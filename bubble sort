Input: arr[] = {5, 1, 4, 2, 8}

First Pass: 

Bubble sort starts with very first two elements, comparing them to check which one is greater.
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1. 
( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4 
( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2 
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.
Second Pass: 

Now, during second iteration it should look like this:
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) 
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
Third Pass: 

Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed.
The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
